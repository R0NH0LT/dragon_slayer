This is a project I made, inspired by a practice course on freeCodeCamp.org. I enjoyed it so much, I recreated it, personalized it and made it my own. The HTML and CSS are my own but the Javascript is very much inspired by the course and only added to or embellished by me. I really enjoyed the course and learned a lot.
